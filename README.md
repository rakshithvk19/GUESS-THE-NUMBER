# GUESS-THE-NUMBER

This is the first project that I built over the duration of learning the course
'The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!' by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy.

This a simple game that responds to the user guessing the correct random number between the ranges of 1 to 20.

Rules:

- Secret number is chosen between 1 to 20 using Math.random().
- The user has to select any number and based on the response, the clue in the screen changes.
- Once the user selects the correct secret number the UI changes and the game is won.

The project is developed using MVC architecture for ease of maintenance and code readability.
